# Customer Analytics
Data Analytics and Machine Learning are tools to enable businesses to thrive and grow. A good analytics solution tells a story of the past, present and the future, and is about finding hidden patterns in data to provide critical business insights and drive business change.

## Business Questions
1. What products are customers likely to buy, based on their previous purchase?
2. How does online traffic correlate to store traffic and store sales?
3. What is the profile of my best customers? Who is likely to defect?
4. How can I dynamically adjust my forecasts to minimize the demand-supply gap and optimize inventory?
5. What is the profile of an average customer? Which customers are likely to churn?
6. What are the behaviors and attributes typical of a successful subscription member?
7. Which sellers are most loyal and likely to refer customers to my shop? Which sellers are likely to split?

## Machine Learning Technique to Answer that question
1. **Recommendation System**

    A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item

2. **Next Best Offer/ Next Best Product/ Next Best Action**

    Next-best-action marketing (also known as best next action or next best activity or recommended action), as a special case of next-best-action decision-making, is a customer-centric marketing paradigm that considers the different actions that can be taken for a specific customer and decides on the ‘best’ one.[1] The Next Best Action (an offer, proposition, service, etc.) is determined by the customer’s interests and needs on the one hand, and the marketing organization’s business objectives, policies on the other. This is in sharp contrast to traditional marketing approaches that first create a proposition for a product or service and then attempt to find interested and eligible prospects for that proposition. This practice, direct marketing, typically automated in the form of a campaign management tool, is often product-centric, and usually always marketing-centric
